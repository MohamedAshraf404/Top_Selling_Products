## How to Recreate the Dashboard
1. Import the `Top_Selling_Products.xlsx` dataset into Power BI.
2. Use the data to create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables.
3. Apply filters and slicers to allow users to interact with the data.
4. Export the final dashboard as a PDF for sharing.

## Measures Used in Power BI
To calculate the KPIs and metrics, the following **DAX Measures** were used in Power BI:

### 1. **Total Units Sold**
```DAX
Total Units Sold = SUM('Sheet1'[Units Sold])
```

### 2. **Total Revenue**
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUMX('Sheet1', 'Sheet1'[Price ($)] * 'Sheet1'[Units Sold])
```

### 3. **Average Rating**
```DAX
Average Rating = AVERAGE('Sheet1'[Rating])
```

### 4. **Total Tax**
```DAX
Total Tax = [Total Revenue] * 0.14  // Assuming a tax rate of 14%
```

### 5. **Average Price**
```DAX
Average Price = AVERAGE('Sheet1'[Price ($)])
```

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the top-selling products across various categories. The Power BI dashboard offers an interactive way to explore the data and understand the key trends and metrics.
